For MM+ Moder:
Leave the Key empty.
Since Linux still doesn't support H264 decode,you should always use VP9 to convert your video file to USM.

You can find some keys at <a href="https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/master/src/meta/adx_keys.h">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/master/src/meta/hca_keys.h">here</a>

FFmpeg convert VP9 is slow,so if you didn't want waste your time on convert,you can upload your video to youtube,and use the youtube mode to convert.
